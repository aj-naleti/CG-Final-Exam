# CG Final Exam
 
Anja Biskupic 100886964 (Odd exam) Super Mario World

Shaders needed: Color correction and Holograms
Additional shaders: Toon Outline and pixelation

Camera movement with WASD and mouse

For the main part of enhancing Super Mario World I decided I wanted to make it more self aware in a sense that the game knows its a game, and I made it look just slightly corrupted with the pixellated skybox and weird color grading. 
I used Donut Plains from SMW as a reference.
I made the coins holographic to fit with the original UI of the game, the breakable boxes are holographic on the outside with a solid core to make them more interesting, recreated the clouds as close as I could with the toon outline shader and I added the pixelation to more match the original style. Added the skybox so it's not just floating in nothingness and to boost the "corrupted" aspect of the idea.
